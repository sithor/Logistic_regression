# Logistic_regression

This is a shiny app that displays a 3d plot of binary outcome data, with continuous independent variables of exposures. 
Various types of logistic regression model planes may be shown. A corresponding regression nomogram is also drawn.

The data comes from a case-control study of cot death carried out in the 1980s in New Zealand.
